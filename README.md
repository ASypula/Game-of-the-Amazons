# Game of the Amazons
Project for a course Programming Fundamentals at Warsaw University of Technology

An abstract strategy game. It is played on a chess-like board, but the size of the board is not fixed. The game differs a bit from the standard version as there could be treasure or some artifact on each field of the board and the winner is the one who scored the most points.
Version for two players as well as for one with the program as the opponent are available.
